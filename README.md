Cherry-Compatible Keyswitch Tester
==================================

This is a simple keyswitch tester PCB for Cherry-compatible mechanical keyboard
switches.  It holds four keyswitches using Kailh's hotswap switch sockets and
has an LED wired to each switch, providing a quick and simple way to test the
actuation point of various switches.  This board is powered either by a
MicroUSB connector, or optionally instead via a 2 x 0.1" header connected to a
5 V power supply.

Most of this board can easily be assembled by hand, except for the MicroUSB
connector which is a bit more tricky, so if soldering this by hand, you may
prefer to use the header pins instead.
